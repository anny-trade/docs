# What is the Anny Signal API for partners?

The Signal API allows partner channels to create and manage trading signals programmatically. Signals are distributed to subscribed users who can auto-execute them on connected exchanges.

## Base URL

```
https://api.anny.trade
```

## Versions

| Version | Path | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **V1** | `/v1/signal` | Original. Range entry, up to 6 take-profit targets. |
| **V2** | `/v2/signal` | Extended. Adds leverage, margin type, split entry allocation, mid entry price. |

Both versions are active. V2 is recommended for new integrations.
